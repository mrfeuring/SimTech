My small, basement, tech company website


I have been doing a small number of computer repairs lately and it has me thinking about a little side business. I actually don't envision this to really take off. I'm just thinking it would be fun to have a website and a few business cards that can be handed out to my customers. I have a small amount of programming knowledge, but it has been all self-taught. I will be sticking with that idea- adding to my site with every new skill I learn. 

Side note: this will be quite difficult for me. I have a hard time playing with just the basics. I always want to jump in and make something <i>way</i> above my skill level. I want to do this right though. It would be so fun to add web development alongside my few repairs.
